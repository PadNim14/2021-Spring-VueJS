# Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays
Software Saturdays is an event commitee hosted jointly by the Purdue University College of Engineering and the Purdue IEEE Student Branch.
It aims to teach engineers modern software development skils that are useful no matter what industry our attendees are a part of.
