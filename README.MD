# Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays
Software Saturdays is an event commitee hosted jointly by the Purdue University College of Engineering and the Purdue IEEE Student Branch.
It aims to teach engineers modern software development skils that are useful no matter what industry our attendees are a part of.
This spring semester, we are teaching Web App Development using VueJS.

## Final Project
The final project for this semester is to build a To-Do web app using a VueJS frontend and NoSQL database.
Participants are expected to implement proper CRUD principles in their program.

## Lesson Plan
1. Lesson 1 introduced HTML and CSS. We covered basic HTML layout, HTML tags, and CSS properties.
2. Lesson 2 introduced JavaScript. We covered basic JavaScript and how to add it to a web page.
3. Lesson 3 introduced VueJS. We covered basic formatting, the Vue instance, and v- directives.
4. Lesson 4 introduced Vue components. We covered registering components, template strings, and custom events.
5. Lesson 5 introduces NoSQL databases. We cover what NoSQL is, using Google [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), and integrating databases with Vue.
